# OnPoint 

Started as a WordPress blog back in 2015, this is a website that I am developing as a platform to share content realted to the areas of Training, Nutrition and Fitness. Although libraries and frameworks could be considered to add more complex functionality, my main goal is to stick to the core fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
