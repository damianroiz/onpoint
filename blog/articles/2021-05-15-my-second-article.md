Sleeping is the key element for recovery and the foundation for physical performance. It is vastly more important than your training, your diet, your supplements, and anything else you might be part of your “recovery toolkit”. Improving sleep quality has a direct impact on muscle recovery and muscle growth, stress levels reduction, improved mood and concentration, cognitive functions, and more stable and predictable energy levels throughout the day. By the time you finish this article, you will be equipped with some really effective techniques to radically optimize your sleep. Best of all, they are all simple enough to be implemented as soon as tonight.

## First Thing First...

Sleeping is the key element for recovery and the foundation for physical performance. It is vastly more important than your training, your diet, your supplements, and anything else you might be part of your “recovery toolkit”. Improving sleep quality has a direct impact on muscle recovery and muscle growth, stress levels reduction, improved mood and concentration, cognitive functions, and more stable and predictable energy levels throughout the day. By the time you finish this article, you will be equipped with some really effective techniques to radically optimize your sleep. Best of all, they are all simple enough to be implemented as soon as tonight.

### Stage One 

Do you remember that boring class where you were drowsing off and weightlifting your eyelids to avoid falling asleep? Welcome to the first stage in your sleeping cycle. This first stage, which we experience while still under consciousness, has lower brain waves called Alpha and Theta. These waves leave us in a state of deep relaxation as our respiration and heart rate slightly drops and our minds switch over to a state of creativity and relaxation.(1)

### Stage Two 

At this stage, the brain starts to shut off but we still remain under a certain level of consciousness as the body prepares to go into deep sleep. We experience patterns of brain waves called sleep spindles, and K-Complexes which create a sudden burst of brain activity.(1)

### Stages Three And Four

We have to get to these two stages to experience deep sleep with blood pressure, respiration and heart rate reaching their lowest point. The brain moves back and forth from theta waves to delta waves which are of very low frequency.(1) It is during these stages that anabolic processes take place as GH activates and there is an outflow of blood from the organs to the muscles to nourish and repair body tissue.

### Stage Five: REM

REM (Rapid Eye Movement) is the last stage of a sleeping cycle in which the eyes move rapidly in every direction as the brain experiences intense wave activity as if you were fully awake. At this stage we experience nice dreams or terrifying nightmares.(1) During REM is also when we learn as short-term memories and experiences get saved as long-term memories.

While we sleep we go from Stage One to Rem multiple times. So in order to optimize our sleep, we should widen the segments from stage three to REM while taking less time to move away from the early stages.  By applying the following simple techniques, you will be able to sleep deeply and wake up (even by sleeping less time) with both your mind and body fully rested.[(2)](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/strengthen#:~:text=During%20REM%20sleep%2C%20the%20brain%20transfers%20short%2Dterm%20memories%20in,it%20in%20long%2Dterm%20memory.)

## Techniques To Improve Your Sleep

### Assess Your Sleep Pattern

![sleep journal](/assets/blog/bed-journal.png)

You can hit a target that you can’t see so having a well assessed starting point is critical to measure future progress and correct any problems. Are you having trouble falling asleep?  Are you waking up in the middle of the night too many times? Are you sleeping too much or not enough?  Whatever you think is jeopardizing your sleep quality, write it down! Whenever I feel my sleep routine is falling back, I use a sleep journal to write the time I go to bed and the time I wake up as well I any time during the night when I have trouble falling asleep. I keep this practice for two weeks to up to a month every time my sleep routine is derailing. I have found that the practice of tracking down my sleep time in itself helps me correct any deviation in my habits as I try to build a good record.

### Follow A Night Ritual

Prepare yourself to sleep at the same time every day. Putting on your sleeping clothes, like pyjamas (or in my case, just underwear and a t-shirt with a stain of olive oil) and following other nighttime routines like brushing your teeth (and I hope you do) and getting your glass of water . Also, stopping any task that requires high levels of concentration like for example studying. Keeping these habits at night, work perfectly for triggering the signal in your brain that tells it is time to shut down soon.

### Avoid Stimulants

Avoid caffeine and alcohol at least 6 hours before going to sleep: These substances will increase your blood pressure and heart rate, and it takes hours for them to be dumped out of the body. it is therefore better to avoid them at least 8 hours before sleep. They are also known to be diuretic, causing you to wake up many times to pee, which not only affects your sleep quality, but also dehydrates your body at the time [when water is most needed](http://damianroiz.com/water/).

### Control Sugar Consumption

Avoid sweet food and beverages late at night to prevent an insulin spike, which causes some of the same disruptive metabolic effects as the neurotransmitters mentioned above. On top of that, sleep deprivation has a negative correlation in insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, so this feeds a vicious cycle of increased accumulated blood sugar levels, which is the main cause for diabetes.[(3)](https://www.alaskasleep.com/blog/blood-sugar-and-sleep-problems)

### Sleep In Total Darkness

Melatonin is the hormone that signals the brain it is time to shut off, this photosensitive hormone, which is produced in the pineal gland and found highly  concentrated in the retina and skin, gets activated when you are exposed to darkness. Melatonin plays a big role in what makes us diurnal creatures, by wiring us to sleep at night. Therefore, sleeping in total darkness, to the point that you are not able to see your own hand in front of you, creates the perfect conditions for the natural release of melatonin in order to fall asleep faster.[(4)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6802208/)

### Stay Away From Electronics

Just as total darkness stimulates the production of melatonin, electronic gadgets like cell phones, TVs, and computers, suppress it. These devices produce blue lights, short range perceptible wavelengths lights help boost alertness and mood when we are naturally exposed to them during daylight hours. They produce a disruptive effect at night though, by throwing the circadian rhythm out of whack. And not only that, research shows that exposure to these lights is also linked to obesity as well as other diseases.[(5)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side&sa=D&ust=1591498047250000&usg=AFQjCNEKRx786JuI8Eto4s4AVSvtT-w4sw)

### Get More Sunlight

Besides being a good supplier of vitamin A, the sun is also by far the most natural (and cheaper) body’s stimulant. Sunlight exposure, especially during early morning hours keeps the circadian clock in check and helps raise body temperature, to remain awake, alert and productive during the day. On the other hand, poor exposure to natural light leads to feelings of drowsiness and bad mood, unstable levels of energy and difficulty to fall asleep which can lead to insomnia.

### Exercise During The Day

Exercising during the morning generates more stable energy levels during the day and a subsequent drastic drop in body temperature at night. On the other hand, intense physical activity performed during late night hours causes core body temperature and stress hormones such cortisol and adrenaline to rise, which neutralizes the body’s efforts to enter in a state of deep relaxation necessary to fall asleep. [(6)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep)

I told you it was going to be simple right? As we can see, sleep optimization comes down to spending more time in deep sleep, which is more dependable upon habits than any other magic formula. Start by assessing your own situation and make sure that factors like light exposure, exercise and stimulants are playing on your side. Adjusting these variables is an easy fix that would pay you back huge dividends in the form of improved physical and cognitive performance. 

Your body and mind will thank you for that...

Have a good night!
