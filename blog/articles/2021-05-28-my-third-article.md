High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is one of the most well known training style to lose fat and improve cardiovascular health. It consists in combining lapses of low intensity with bursts of high intensity, which you can implement simply by adding short sprints to your current jogging routine or any other known-to-be-good-for-cardio activity like biking, hiking or my favourite, swimming, which I call HIIS (high intensity interval swimming), going for two laps at slow to intermediate speed, followed by one lap at maximum speed that I try to complete without breathing, while imagining there is a shark or crocodile chasing me (I know you might be thinking I have mental issues, but believe me, if you have good imagination, it definitely works!)

Alright, enough with imaginary animals, here are some of the reasons that allow HIIT to  provide such incredible results...

## Burn Calories

HIIT is really taxing on the metabolism, melting fat as if you were a slice of bacon cooking in a pan. This is due to this high-metabolic effect called post-exercise oxygen consumption or EPOC which comes as a natural body response to the stress generated from high intensity physical activity. Scientists from the University of Alabama compared energy expenditure during the 24 hours following exercise on both one group that cycled for 60 minutes at steady moderate intensity and another group that cycled for two minutes at high intensity followed by two minutes of low intensity. The results showed that the group that performed HIIT burned 160 more calories in 24 hours than the low intensity group.

## Wake up hormones

Drastic repeated fluctuations in physical activity intensity causes a hormonal shock that favours the reduction of insulin resistance over time due to cells becoming more efficient at recruiting stored glucose as a source of energy. Data from studies investigating the effect of HIIT on improving insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism indicates this can be improved 23% to 58%. Other released hormones are adrenaline and noradrenaline, known for triggering lipolysis, a process by which subcutaneous and intramuscular fat tissue is released for the production of ATP. Stimulating these hormones can therefore contribute to decreasing fat levels located in the mid-section where it tends to be more stubborn.[(2)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobe/2011/868305/)

## Build a kick-ass heart

Studies have shown that HDL (High Density Lipoprotein) which is tagged as “good cholesterol” improves after a minimum of 8 weeks of training. [(2)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobe/2011/868305/) his paired with the fat loss properties of HIIT mentioned above, generates improvements in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and blood triglycerides levels, which contributes to the betterment of cardiovascular health. Is this only reserved to fit people ? It is not. Cardiovascular health benefits also extend to  patients with lower aerobic fitness such as those recovering from CHD (coronary heart disease) when applied to their cardiac rehabilitation program.

## Program Introduction

This 4-week HIIT program is ideal if you are looking to lose fat while remaining in an anaerobic threshold. The approach is similar to lifting weights in a common set-by-reps fashion, however in this case, you will be depleting your glycogen reserves much faster as we intend to tap into stored fat for the production of energy. To accomplish this, we will combine treadmill work with bodyweight exercises. Feel free to choose any cardio machine or outdoor activity. As long as you are able to incorporate bursts of high intensity, anything from biking to rowing machines would also do the job. However, the program that follows is based on the treadmill as a way to better measure weekly progress in cardiovascular endurance and agility on a defined speed progression.

Once the first part of work in the treadmill is completed, we move on to an EMOM (every minute on the minute) circuit in which you have to perform all reps for each exercise in one minute followed by a minute of rest, going through the same sequence (one minute on, one minute off) until completing the total time each week. 

The is meant to be a stand-alone program so you might want to dedicate exclusively a day each week to complete it. However, if you decide to take this program as an add-on to your current strength routine, make sure you are giving yourself adequate time for recovery.

### Program Goals

* Improve Lean Muscle Mass / Fat Ratio
* Improve Cardiovascular Endurance
* Increase Metabolic Rate

### Guidelines

Start this first portion on the treadmill by warming up at your desired speed (4 mph to 6 mph as an example) before jumping in to the rounds, aim at keeping a “jog speed” at around 8 mph and “sprint speed” from 10 to 12 mph. Always remember to take these speed levels as guidance and adjust the intensity to a level that allows you to challenge yourself while remaining within the 2:1 ratio. Before you start, invest some time to play around with your treadmill setup, there are some that come already with a HIIT function in which you can enter speed levels as well other variables such as warm-up, cool-down and inclination to have them changed automatically.

### Part One: HIIT

|                      | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3   | Week 4   |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Warm-up              | 5'     | 5'     | 5'       | 5'       |
| 60' Run / 30' Sprint | 6 RNDs | 8 RNDs | 10' RNDs | 12' RNDs |
| Cool-Down            | 10'    | 10'    | 10'      | 10'      |
| Total Time           | 24'    | 27'    | 30'      | 33'      |

Start your warm-up from a higher than walking pace (3.5 mph), increasing steadily until you run for at least one minute at a slightly-higher-than-normal jog speed. Feel free to adjust your total warm-up time until you reach the point of increased body temperature and accelerated breath.

To complete each round (RND) you have to run for 60 seconds followed by 30 seconds of sprint at a sustainable speed. We are progressively increasing the number of as we move on during the weeks , starting at 6 rounds on the first week, expecting to double that amount by the end of the program while maintaining a 2:1 ratio

Once you complete all prescribed rounds, cool down ideally at the same jogging speed you left off when you finished your warm-up, the only difference here is that you are going to keep that steady speed in order to lower your heart rate.

At this point you are free from the treadmill, so congratulations for that! Now, [give yourself some time to drink some water](https://damianroiz.com/water), stretch, and rest for about 5 to 10 minutes so that you can get ready for the next EMOM.

### Part Two: EMOM

Week 1 	Week 2 	Week 3 	Week 4	
3 Sets 	3 Sets 	4 Sets 	4 Sets
Push-Up
10 reps 	Diamond Push-Up
10 reps 	Superman Push-Up
12 reps 	Elevated Push-Up
12 reps
Hollow Body Rock
20 reps 	Sit-Up to Bridge
20 reps 	V-Up
15 reps 	Turtle Squat
12 reps
Plank
1 minute 	Side Plank
30 seconds (each side) 	Inverted Plank
1 minute 	Wall Plank
1 minute

This is an EMOM (every minute on the minute) in which you have to complete the prescribed sets or time for each exercise in one minute followed by a minute of rest, going through the same sequence  (one minute on, one minute off) until completing the total prescribed time each week. 

### Cool-down

Cat Stretch 	45 seconds
Standing One-Legged Quad Stretch 	45 seconds (each side)
Calf Stretch Against Wall 	45 seconds (each side)
Hurdler Hamstring Stretch 	45 seconds (each side)
Belly Breathing 	5 Minutes

### Build from here...

If you are looking to burn fat in short yet effective sessions without jeopardizing your plans to grow muscle mass while also improving your cardiovascular health, HIIT is a perfect approach that brings the best out of each world. You can now count on this program as a foundation from which you can advance upon and adapt to your own fitness needs.  If you are new to HIIT, start small, respecting your own adaptation process so that this training merges well into your current routine.
